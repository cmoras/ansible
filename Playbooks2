In this we can discuss about how to issue sudo, type of cnnection, types of variables, prompts


lets take an example:
---
- hosts: ubuntu,debian                                                  ##here are defining more that one host group
  user: ansible                                                         ##which user is beign used for the execution of the playbook
  sudo: yes                                                             ##sudo is set as yes,  meaning we no more need to go for ansible-playbook -s test.yml, -s can be skipped.
  connection: ssh                                                       ##connectiontype --> ssh
  gather_facts: no
  vars:                                                                 ##vars: are local variables, so no tick mark
    playbook_version: 0.1b
  vars_files:                                                           ##vars_files:  are externally defined variables, hence the tick mark. in this case copyright.yml is another file in the same dir.
    - copyright.yml
  vars_prompt:
    - name: web_domain
      prompt: web domain
  tasks:
  - name: Install httpd 
    apt: name=apache2 state=absent update_cache=yes
  - name: Copying a file from host to agent node.
    copy: src=clen.txt dest=/home/ansible/new.txt owner=ansible mode=666
