As usual, if you have tried setting it up earlier, we start with removing all traces of it ,  cuz it is bound to cause issue.  
This is something that is of the highest priority.

ubuntu and dereivates:

sudo dpkg -l | grep ansible
sudo apt-get remove --purge ansible
sudo apt-get clean

cents and redhat:
yum list | grep ansible 
yum remove ansible



Starting with installation [in this  case in centos as the control node]:

control node:
-------------
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install git python python-devel python-pip openssl ansible
sudo yum update

here we can test out if ansible has indeed installed by running 
ansible --verson

This should give out the version of the ansible package that you have installed

Next make changes to /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 

Make the following changes under the default category:

[defaults]

# some basic default values...

inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts
#library        = /usr/share/my_modules/
#module_utils   = /usr/share/my_module_utils/
#remote_tmp     = ~/.ansible/tmp
#local_tmp	= ~/.ansible/tmp
#plugin_filters_cfg = /etc/ansible/plugin_filters.yml
#forks          = 5
#poll_interval  = 15
sudo_user      = root
#ask_sudo_pass = True
#ask_pass      = True
#transport	= smart
#remote_port    = 22
#module_lang    = C
#module_set_locale = False

sudo adduser ansible
sudo su -
visudo
Add the following entry under root section. this section is added simply so the password is not asked, when running ansible.

## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
ansible ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD:ALL

Once this is done, test by loggin into ansible account with the password that was given while creation.
And try to update using a sudo command. It should not ask for the password.


Agent nodes:
-------------
same as earlier --
sudo adduser ansible
sudo passwd ansible if necessary 
sudo su -
visudo 

and make the changes


Once the hosts have been setup.  we go back to the control node and edit the file 
nano /etc/ansible/hosts

move the file mv /etc/ansible/hosts /etc/ansible/hosts.originaldo

touch /etc/ansible/hosts


In our case we have created 3 vm's where centos is control, ubuntu and debian are agents. 
So my file looks like this:

[local]
localhost

[ubuntu]
apacemc5.mylabserver.com

[debian]
apacemc6.mylabserver.com


-----------------------------------------------
Moving over to the password less auth, we need to pass keys between control and agent 

Log into the agents and run the following:

su ansible
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id ansible@$whatever_your_control_node_is,in_my_case_it_is_centos

that should do the trick.  try loggin into the server. shouldn't ask for passkey

also log into the control node and type the following, if you want to test out ansible with localhost

su ansible
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id ansible@localhost

we are good to go ahead!!!!

With this done, time for some ping-pong.
